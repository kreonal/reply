# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned to use the library by reading through the API's documentation and examples. Fortunately, the examples were very clear despite not being commented thoroughly. Writing the comments also helped me because if I was able to explain what the code was doing, then my understanding of how to use the library increased. One aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand is the clear variable/function names. Good naming goes a long way in helping users know what is going on. One change that would have made it easier would be for the code to include clear comments on the types of some of the variables/returns. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> To me, raising the level of abstraction means stating the main ideas/concepts/purposes that should be taken away from the code. If I ahd to explain how to write an effective comment, I would tell the student that they shouldn't go into detail about the actual lines of code, but instead discuss the code's purpose as if the person reading the comments knows very little about prgoramming. 

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 5 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I had to Google search some syntax in the code that I didn't understand.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Nope!
